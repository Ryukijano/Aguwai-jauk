# LinkedIn Post - Teacher Job Portal for Assam

üöÄ Excited to share my latest side project: An AI-powered Teacher Job Portal specifically designed for educators in Assam!

As someone passionate about education and technology, I noticed a gap in how teachers find opportunities in our region. Traditional job boards don't understand the unique requirements of Assam's education system - from TET/CTET certifications to language proficiencies to specific school board requirements.

## üéØ What Makes This Different?

**1. AI-Powered Multi-Agent System**
- **Resume Analyzer**: Uses Google's ADK patterns with Gemini 2.5 for deep analysis with confidence scoring
- **Smart Job Matching**: Intelligent filtering that understands Assam's geography and education landscape
- **Interview Coach**: Personalized prep with cultural considerations for local schools
- **Career Advisor**: Context-aware guidance based on your journey

**2. Built for Teachers, by Understanding Teachers**
- Weighted scoring system (Education 30%, Experience 25%, Certifications 20%)
- Career roadmaps with immediate, short-term, and long-term action plans
- Market insights specific to government vs private schools in Assam
- Demo lesson planning and salary negotiation guidance

**3. Tech Stack That Scales**
- React + TypeScript frontend with mobile-first PWA design
- Express backend with PostgreSQL
- Dual AI integration: OpenAI GPT-4o + Google Gemini 2.5
- LangGraph orchestration for stateful conversations

## üåü The Vision

My goal is to democratize access to quality teaching opportunities in Assam. By leveraging AI, we can:

‚úÖ Help fresh B.Ed graduates find their first position
‚úÖ Enable experienced teachers to advance their careers strategically
‚úÖ Bridge the gap between rural talent and urban opportunities
‚úÖ Provide data-driven insights for better career decisions

## ü§ù Impact So Far

- Comprehensive job matching across government and private institutions
- Personalized career guidance available 24/7
- Resume analysis that understands local education requirements
- Interview preparation tailored to Assam's school culture

## üîÆ What's Next?

- Integration with APSC and SSA notifications
- Real-time salary benchmarking
- Community features for teacher networking
- Expansion to other northeastern states

This project combines my love for technology with a mission to strengthen education in our region. Every teacher deserves to find their perfect opportunity, and AI can help make that happen.

Would love to hear your thoughts! How do you think technology can further transform education recruitment?
