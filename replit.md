## Deployment Configuration (Updated July 27, 2025 - Final)
The project is now fully configured for production deployment with all deployment issues resolved:

### Applied Deployment Fixes
- âœ… Fixed "dev command blocked" error by using production commands in `replit.toml`
- âœ… Updated `replit.toml` with correct production run command
- âœ… Enhanced production deployment script (`deploy.sh`) with comprehensive error handling
- âœ… Set NODE_ENV=production environment variable for proper production configuration
- âœ… Configured production build and start commands instead of development commands
- âœ… Added dependency installation and build verification to deployment process

### Production Scripts
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Builds frontend with Vite and bundles backend with esbuild
- **Start**: `npm run start` - Runs the production server with NODE_ENV=production
- **Deploy Script**: `deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script with comprehensive error handling

### Deployment Files
1. **replit.toml**: Production configuration for Replit deployments
   - Uses production build and start commands: `npm run build && npm run start`
   - Sets NODE_ENV to production
   - Configures proper port mapping (5000 â†’ 80)
   - Replaces development commands with production-ready alternatives

2. **deploy.sh**: Production deployment script (executable)
   - Builds the application with error checking
   - Handles build failures gracefully with clear error messages
   - Starts the production server with proper error handling
   - Sets production environment variables

### Deployment Notes
- The default `.replit` file uses development commands which are blocked in production deployments
- For deployment, Replit will automatically use the `replit.toml` configuration which contains production-ready commands
- Alternative deployment option: Use the `deploy.sh` script directly for manual deployments with comprehensive error handling
- Production build verified working correctly with no errors
- All deployment security blocks have been resolved

### Deployment Status
ðŸŸ¢ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - All configuration files are properly set up for production deployment

### How to Deploy
1. **Automatic Deployment**: Click the Deploy button in Replit - it will automatically use `replit.toml` with production commands
2. **Manual Deployment**: Run `./deploy.sh` for manual deployment with error handling
3. **Direct Commands**: Use `npm run build && npm run start` for production mode

The deployment will now use production commands instead of blocked development commands.
4. **AI Assistant**: Advanced conversational AI with job search capabilities
5. **Profile Management**: Update personal and professional information
6. **Calendar Integration**: Track important dates and interviews
7. **Document Management**: Store resumes and certificates

## Environment Variables Required
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: For Google Gemini AI capabilities
- `SESSION_SECRET`: For secure session management (auto-generated if not provided)

## Development Guidelines
- Use the existing shadcn components for consistency
- Follow the established TypeScript patterns
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Keep AI responses helpful and contextual to teaching jobs in Assam
